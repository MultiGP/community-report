# Welcome
This is a place the community of MultiGP pilots and organizers to report bugs and suggest feature improvements for MultiGP's website and applications. If you are new to Github, you will have to create a [new account](https://github.com/signup) before you can submit an [issue](https://github.com/MultiGP/Community-Report/issues).

Make sure there aren't already similar [issues](https://github.com/MultiGP/Community-Report/issues) to yours, before submitting a new one. The more detail you can provide to us about your issue or suggestion, the better (detailed description, step by step to reproduce, images/screenshots, etc.)
